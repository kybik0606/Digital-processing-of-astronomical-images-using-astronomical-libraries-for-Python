My project is largely based on the Astropy - [CCD reduction and photometry library guide](https://www.astropy.org/ccd-reduction-and-photometry-guide/v/dev/notebooks/00-00-Preface.html).
But I'm trying to add something of my own.
I am interested in astrophotography, and most of the time I only received data, and processed it in special programs.
However, now I wanted to explore the whole process from the beginning, so I created this repository.
